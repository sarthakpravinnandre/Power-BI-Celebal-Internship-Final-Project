üìä Power BI ‚Äì Pool Code Mapping Status Dashboard

‚úÖ Project Status: Completed

This repository contains the Power BI project developed during my internship at Celebal Technologies. The objective was to build a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into the status of pool code mapping for financial products.

üöÄ Objective

To design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that tracks and analyzes the mapping status of various pool codes. The dashboard supports informed decision-making, regulatory compliance, and strategic planning.

üß† Key Features
The Pool Code Mapping Status Dashboard is designed to deliver actionable insights with a focus on clarity, usability, and interactivity. It begins with a high-level Overview Section, which showcases essential KPIs, including the total number of pool codes, how many are currently mapped, unmapped, and how many are associated with ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) mapping. This section helps stakeholders instantly assess the overall mapping health and coverage.

The Mapping Status Table presents granular details for each individual pool code. It includes fields such as the pool code itself, its current mapping status (Mapped / Unmapped / ERM Mapped), the designated product head, the name of the product linked to the code, and the last date the information was updated. This table allows users to perform record-level audits and is crucial for operations, audit, and compliance teams.

What sets this dashboard apart is its dynamic interactivity. Users can filter data using slicers based on criteria such as fund type, reporting date, and optionally by product or branch (if applicable). Visual elements such as charts and graphs are fully interactive‚Äîclicking on any data point dynamically filters and updates other visual components across the report, including the mapping status table. This ensures that users get contextual insights with minimal navigation.

Moreover, all tables and visuals respond in real-time to slicer selections, offering a personalized and focused analysis experience. This level of interactivity transforms the dashboard from a static report into a powerful decision-support tool that adapts to the user‚Äôs specific informational needs.
